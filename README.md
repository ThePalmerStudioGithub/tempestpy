# TempestPy
> Presenting TempestPy, a suite of simple Python scripts/programs for hobby weather enthusiasts or anyone who just wants it:)

> This project is powered by MetPy

> This project is open source, which means if you want to make improvements to it, go right ahead, just know that obviously, if you do something bad, it gets logged....

> Below is a step by step guide on how to get TempestPy up and running!
